setwd("/home/student/container-data/project")
load('alldata.RDdata')
alldata <- as.data.frame(alldata)
```


```{r}
cor (alldata[which(alldata$ArrDelay > 0),c("DepDelay","ArrDelay")])
pairs(alldata[which(alldata$ArrDelay > 15),c("DepDelay","ArrDelay")], pch = '.')
```

DepDelay had a high correlation with ArrDelay. Therefore, most ArrDelay were caused by DepDelay.
